# Final Git Steps to Push Discord Integration

## The pull started working! Now complete the process manually:

### Step 1: Clear Git Locks Again
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock .git/config.lock
```

### Step 2: Check What Was Downloaded
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 3: Stage Your Discord Changes
```bash
git add automated_trading_alerts.py requirements.txt replit.md
git add simple_discord_test.py consolidated_alerts_test.py
```

### Step 4: Commit Discord Integration
```bash
git commit -m "Add Discord bot integration: TITAN BOT#6444 with AI-enhanced alerts

- Replace webhook system with discord.py integration  
- Add AI-powered analysis to all 3 Discord channels
- Fix pandas/numpy compatibility 
- Successfully tested with immediate alert delivery
- Ready for Railway deployment with DISCORD_TOKEN"
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub (with authentication)
```bash
git push origin main
```

## If Authentication Fails:
You may need to authenticate with GitHub. Try:
- Using GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
- Or use the Git pane in Replit's sidebar (easier authentication)

## Alternative: Use Replit's Git UI
1. Click Git icon in left sidebar
2. Stage files: automated_trading_alerts.py, requirements.txt, replit.md
3. Commit with message about Discord bot integration
4. Push (Replit handles authentication automatically)

## What's Happening:
- Your GitHub repo data was successfully downloaded
- Your Discord integration needs to be added to it
- Once pushed, Railway will auto-deploy with Discord bot functionality
