# Manual Git Commands to Fix Railway Deployment

## The Problem
- Railway deployment is timing out completely
- ChatGPT cannot access any endpoints because Railway isn't responding
- Local server works perfectly, but Railway deployment is broken

## Required Manual Steps

### Step 1: Clean Up Requirements File
```bash
# Create clean requirements.txt without duplicates
cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
Flask==2.3.3
Flask-CORS==4.0.0  
ccxt==4.4.98
requests==2.31.0
aiohttp==3.12.15
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
schedule==1.2.0
pytz==2023.3
discord.py==2.3.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
openai==1.3.8
trafilatura==1.6.3
EOF
```

### Step 2: Stage and Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "URGENT: Fix Railway deployment timeout

- Clean requirements.txt (remove duplicates)
- Fix ChatGPT schema endpoints
- Resolve Railway startup issues"
```

### Step 3: Push to Railway
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to deploy, then test
curl "https://titan-trading-2-production.up.railway.app/health"
```

### Expected Results
- Railway should respond with JSON instead of timing out
- ChatGPT should be able to call working endpoints
- API integration should work properly

## Current Working Endpoints (Local)
- `/health` - Server status
- `/api/live/all-exchanges` - Complete position data
- `/api/chatgpt/portfolio-analysis` - AI analysis

The main issue is Railway deployment, not the individual endpoints.
