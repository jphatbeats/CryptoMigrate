ISSUE RESOLVED: Railway is working perfectly!

PROVEN WORKING:
✅ Railway deployment is live and functional
✅ /api/live/all-exchanges returns complete position data:
   - ETH: 1.41 contracts, +$35.92 profit
   - XRP: 824 contracts, +$1,071.29 profit  
✅ HTTP 200 responses, valid JSON

PROBLEM:
❌ ChatGPT schema still contains broken individual endpoints
❌ getBingXPositions, getKrakenBalance return HTML error pages
❌ ChatGPT calls wrong endpoints instead of working /api/live/all-exchanges

SOLUTION:
1. Schema already partially fixed (broken operationIds removed)
2. Need to push updated no_auth_schema.json to Railway
3. ChatGPT will then use working endpoints only

Railway deployment is fine - just needs schema update pushed.
