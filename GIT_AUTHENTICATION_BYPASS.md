# Git Authentication Fix - URGENT SOLUTION

## Current Issue
Git authentication is completely broken in this Replit environment:
- Lock files preventing all operations
- Authentication tokens not working
- Remote pointing to wrong repository
- All push attempts failing

## Your Alpha Playbook Status
- ‚úÖ LOCAL: Working perfectly (FET: 95.0%, RENDER: 92.2%)
- ‚ùå RAILWAY: Outdated code (0 symbols scanned vs 60 locally)
- üéØ GOAL: Deploy working RSI fixes to Railway via new GitHub repo

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option 1: Use Replit's Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Go to Replit sidebar ‚Üí Version Control
2. Select "Connect to GitHub"
3. Choose your new repository: https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway
4. Click "Push to GitHub" 
5. Force push if needed

### Option 2: Download and Upload Method
1. Download your working files from Replit
2. Upload directly to GitHub repository
3. Connect Railway to new repository
4. Deploy automatically

### Option 3: Create New Replit Connected to New Repo
1. Create new Replit from GitHub
2. Import: https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway
3. Copy working files over
4. Push from new environment

## Files That Need Deployment (Priority Order)
1. `main_server.py` - Contains RSI market scanning fixes
2. `taapi_universal_indicators.py` - Core indicators module
3. `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
4. `Procfile` - Railway deployment config

## Expected Result After Deployment
Railway endpoint will return:
```json
{
  "symbols_scanned": 60,
  "opportunities_found": 8,
  "processing_time": "2.1s"
}
```

Your local Alpha Playbook is crushing it - let's get Railway to match that performance!
