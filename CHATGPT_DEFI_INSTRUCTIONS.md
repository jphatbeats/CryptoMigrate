# De.Fi DeFi Intelligence API - ChatGPT Instructions

## Overview
De.Fi provides comprehensive DeFi protocol analysis, yield farming opportunities, TVL tracking, and smart contract security assessments. Essential for DeFi opportunities and risk management.

## Available Endpoints

### 1. getProtocols
**Purpose**: Get list of all DeFi protocols with key metrics
**Parameters**:
- `category`: "dex", "lending", "yield", "bridge", "derivatives"
- `chain`: "ethereum", "bsc", "polygon", "avalanche", "arbitrum"
- `limit`: Number of protocols to return

**Strategy**: Use to identify trending protocols by TVL growth, user adoption, and yield opportunities. Focus on protocols with consistent growth and strong fundamentals.

### 2. getProtocolDetails
**Purpose**: Detailed analysis of specific DeFi protocol
**Parameters**:
- `protocol_id`: Protocol identifier
- `timeframe`: "24h", "7d", "30d", "90d"

**Strategy**: Deep dive into protocol metrics including TVL trends, user activity, token distribution, and historical performance. Essential for risk assessment.

### 3. getYieldOpportunities
**Purpose**: Find high-yield farming and staking opportunities
**Parameters**:
- `min_apy`: Minimum APY threshold
- `risk_level`: "low", "medium", "high"
- `asset`: Specific token to find yields for
- `chain`: Blockchain network

**Strategy**: Identify sustainable yield opportunities. Focus on established protocols with consistent APY and low impermanent loss risk. Avoid unsustainable high APY farms.

### 4. getTVLTrends
**Purpose**: Track Total Value Locked trends across protocols
**Parameters**:
- `protocol`: Specific protocol or category
- `timeframe`: Analysis period
- `chain`: Network filter

**Strategy**: TVL growth indicates protocol health and user confidence. Use for identifying growing ecosystems and potential rotation opportunities.

### 5. getBridgeActivity
**Purpose**: Cross-chain bridge volume and activity analysis
**Parameters**:
- `source_chain`: Origin blockchain
- `dest_chain`: Destination blockchain
- `timeframe`: Analysis period

**Strategy**: Bridge activity indicates capital flow between chains. High bridge volume often precedes ecosystem growth on destination chains.

### 6. getSecurityScores
**Purpose**: Smart contract security assessment
**Parameters**:
- `protocol_id`: Protocol to analyze
- `contract_address`: Specific contract address

**Strategy**: Always check security scores before recommending protocols. Avoid protocols with recent exploits or poor security ratings.

### 7. getGovernanceActivity
**Purpose**: DAO governance participation and proposal analysis
**Parameters**:
- `protocol`: DAO/protocol name
- `proposal_status`: "active", "passed", "failed"
- `timeframe`: Analysis period

**Strategy**: Active governance indicates healthy community participation. Monitor proposals that could impact tokenomics or protocol direction.

### 8. getLiquidityPools
**Purpose**: Analyze liquidity pool performance and metrics
**Parameters**:
- `dex`: "uniswap", "sushiswap", "pancakeswap", "curve"
- `pair`: Trading pair like "ETH/USDC"
- `chain`: Network filter

**Strategy**: Find optimal liquidity provision opportunities. Focus on established pairs with good volume-to-liquidity ratios and low impermanent loss.

## DeFi Strategy Framework

### Yield Farming Strategy
1. **Safety First**: Only farm on audited protocols with >6 months track record
2. **Sustainable APY**: Target 8-25% APY from established protocols vs >100% APY farms
3. **Impermanent Loss**: Prefer stablecoin pairs or correlated assets
4. **Lock Period**: Avoid long lock periods during volatile markets
5. **Protocol Risk**: Diversify across multiple protocols and chains

### Protocol Analysis Checklist
- **TVL Trend**: Growing or stable over 30+ days
- **User Growth**: Increasing unique wallet interactions
- **Token Distribution**: No excessive team/VC allocations
- **Audit Status**: Recent security audits with no critical issues
- **Governance**: Active community participation
- **Innovation**: Unique value proposition or competitive moats

### Risk Assessment Matrix
**Low Risk**: Established protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap) with proven track records
**Medium Risk**: Growing protocols with solid fundamentals but shorter history
**High Risk**: New protocols, experimental features, or unaudited contracts
**Extreme Risk**: Anonymous teams, no audits, unsustainable tokenomics

### Chain Analysis Strategy
1. **Ethereum**: Highest security, most established protocols, higher fees
2. **BSC**: Lower fees, higher yield opportunities, moderate security
3. **Polygon**: Good balance of fees and security, growing ecosystem
4. **Avalanche**: Fast transactions, emerging DeFi scene
5. **Arbitrum/Optimism**: L2 solutions with Ethereum security

## Alpha Discovery Process

### 1. TVL Migration Detection
- Monitor bridge activity between chains
- Identify chains receiving large capital inflows
- Research emerging protocols on those chains
- Position before mainstream adoption

### 2. Yield Opportunity Scanning
- Daily scan for new sustainable yield opportunities
- Focus on protocols with growing TVL and user base
- Verify security scores and audit status
- Test with small amounts first

### 3. Protocol Fundamental Analysis
- Analyze tokenomics and emission schedules
- Track governance proposal outcomes
- Monitor developer activity and roadmap progress
- Assess competitive positioning

### 4. Risk-Adjusted Returns
- Calculate returns after gas fees and potential IL
- Factor in protocol risk and smart contract risk
- Consider opportunity cost vs traditional yields
- Set stop-loss triggers for TVL or security changes

## Integration with Other APIs

### With CryptoNews
- News about protocol partnerships or integrations
- Regulatory developments affecting DeFi
- Exploit reports or security concerns
- Major institutional DeFi adoption

### With Technical Analysis
- DeFi token chart analysis for entry/exit timing
- Correlation analysis between protocol tokens
- Support/resistance levels for position sizing
- Volume analysis for liquidity assessment

### Alpha Detection Signals
1. **New Protocol Launch** + **Strong backing** + **Innovative features**
2. **TVL Growth** + **No major news** = Organic adoption
3. **High APY** + **Sustainable tokenomics** + **Good security** = Yield opportunity
4. **Cross-chain expansion** + **Growing ecosystem** = Infrastructure play

## Risk Management Rules
- Never allocate >10% portfolio to single protocol
- Always verify security scores before depositing
- Monitor protocol governance for adverse changes
- Set TVL decline triggers for position exits
- Regularly rebalance based on risk/reward changes

Remember: DeFi moves fast - what's safe today may be risky tomorrow. Constant monitoring and risk assessment are essential for success.
