# Manual Railway Deployment Solution

## Current Situation
- **Local Server:** RSI scanning works perfectly (60 symbols scanned)
- **Railway Server:** Still showing 0 symbols scanned (old buggy code)
- **Git Authentication:** Blocking push despite correct token

## Quick Manual Fix Options

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard Manual Deploy
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your `titan-trading-2-production` project
3. Go to Settings â†’ GitHub
4. Click "Disconnect" then "Reconnect" to refresh the connection
5. Manually trigger a new deployment

### Option 2: Direct File Upload (Fastest)
Since the only critical difference is the RSI scan fixes, you can:

1. Download the working `main_server.py` from this Replit
2. Upload it directly to your GitHub repository via web interface
3. Railway will auto-deploy the updated file

### Option 3: Force Push via Terminal
If you have git access outside Replit:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jphatbeats/CryptoMigrate.git
# Copy the working files from Replit
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy RSI scan fixes to Railway"
git push origin main --force
```

## Expected Result After Fix
ChatGPT RSI scans will show:
```json
{
  "symbols_scanned": 60,  // Instead of 0
  "results": [...actual coins...]
}
```

## Verification
Test with ChatGPT after deployment:
- RSI scan should process 60 symbols 
- MACD scan should work
- Multi-indicator confluence should work

Your local Alpha Playbook is working beautifully - ENS just scored 92.6%! 
We just need Railway to match that performance.
