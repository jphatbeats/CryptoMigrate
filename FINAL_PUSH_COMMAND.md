# FINAL FORCE PUSH COMMAND

## Issue
GitHub rejected the push because it has existing content that conflicts with your fresh repository.

## Solution
Run this command in Replit Shell to force push and overwrite GitHub:

```bash
git push -u $GIT_URL main --force
```

This will:
- Override all content on GitHub 
- Replace it with your complete working Alpha Playbook v4 system
- Preserve all your fixes and improvements
