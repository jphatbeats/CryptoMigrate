# Git Tab Sync Fix - Restore Normal Push/Pull

## Problem
The Replit git tab shows "push branch as origin/main" instead of normal sync because:
- Local branch: `main` 
- Remote branch: `origin/main`  
- No proper branch tracking set up

## Solution
Set up proper branch tracking to restore normal git tab functionality:

```bash
# Set upstream tracking for current branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main

# Or force push to establish tracking
git push -u origin main
```

## Expected Result
After fixing branch tracking, your git tab will show:
- âœ… Normal "Push" and "Pull" buttons
- âœ… Sync status (ahead/behind commits)
- âœ… File-level changes instead of whole branch

## Alternative Fix
If above doesn't work, you can also:
1. **Use the big button once** - it will establish tracking
2. **Or manually set tracking** in git tab settings
3. **Switch to origin/main branch** then switch back to main
