SIMPLE 3-STEP RAILWAY FIX (No new project needed)

STEP 1: Replace requirements.txt
Copy contents from requirements_clean.txt to requirements.txt
(removes duplicate entries causing build failures)

STEP 2: Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway build - clean requirements"
git push origin main

STEP 3: Wait 2-3 minutes
Railway auto-deploys from GitHub push
Test: curl https://titan-trading-2-production.up.railway.app/health

Your existing Railway project will work fine once the build succeeds.
The timeout issue is just a failed build, not a broken deployment setup.
