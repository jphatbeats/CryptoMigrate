# Mobile Claude Persistent Setup Guide
## How to Make Trading Brain Configuration Permanent on Mobile

## Problem: Chat Memory is Temporary
You're right - just putting code in a chat conversation isn't permanent. Mobile Claude needs persistent storage.

## Solution: Multiple Persistent Storage Options

### Option 1: Note-Taking App Storage
Save this configuration in a note app that Mobile Claude can access:

**In Apple Notes / Google Keep / Samsung Notes:**
```

Server URL: https://your-replit-url.replit.app
Device ID: mobile_claude_primary

Quick Functions:
- Read Context: GET /narrative
- Add Entry: POST /narrative
- Position Update: POST /narrative with mobile_update type
- Emergency Alert: POST /narrative with emergency_alert type

Connection Test:
curl https://your-replit-url.replit.app/narrative

Mobile Commands Reference:
GET https://your-replit-url.replit.app/narrative

{
  "type": "mobile_update",
  "content": "Your message here",
  "source_device": "android",
  "created_by": "claude_mobile"
}
```

### Option 2: Cloud Storage Document
Create a document in Google Drive / iCloud / Dropbox:

**File: "Claude_Trading_Brain_Config.txt"**
```

```

### Option 3: Email Draft Storage
Create a draft email to yourself with the configuration:

**Email Subject: "CLAUDE TRADING BRAIN CONFIG - PERMANENT"**
```

## How Mobile Claude Accesses Persistent Config

### Step 1: Reference the Saved Configuration
Mobile Claude says: "Let me check my trading brain configuration from my saved notes"

### Step 2: Use the Stored Information
From the note/document/email, Mobile Claude gets:
- Server URL
- API endpoints
- Request format
- Authentication details

### Step 3: Execute Trading Brain Functions
```bash
# Mobile Claude can then run:
curl -X GET "https://your-replit-url.replit.app/narrative"

curl -X POST "https://your-replit-url.replit.app/narrative" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"mobile_update","content":"Portfolio check from mobile","source_device":"android","created_by":"claude_mobile"}'
```

## Verification That It's Working

### Test 1: Can Mobile Claude Read Context?
Mobile Claude tries: GET https://your-replit-url.replit.app/narrative
Success = Gets JSON with trading history

### Test 2: Can Mobile Claude Write Updates?
Mobile Claude tries: POST with position update
Success = Entry appears in trading brain

### Test 3: Cross-Device Verification
1. Mobile Claude adds entry
2. Desktop Claude reads same entry
3. Replit Claude sees the update

## Making the URL Permanent

### Get Your Permanent Replit URL:
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Deploy the project
4. Copy the deployment URL (this is permanent)
5. Update all your saved configs with this URL

### URL Format Examples:
- Development: `https://project-name.username.replit.dev`
- Production: `https://project-name.username.replit.app`

## Real-World Mobile Workflow

### Morning Check (Mobile Claude):
1. "Let me check my trading brain config from my notes"
2. "I'll read the current portfolio status"
3. GET /narrative request
4. "I can see [X] positions from Desktop Claude's analysis"
5. POST update: "Mobile morning review complete"

### Emergency Alert (Mobile Claude):
1. "Using my saved trading brain config"
2. "I need to send an emergency alert"
3. POST emergency alert about market conditions
4. "Alert sent - Desktop Claude and Replit Claude will see this immediately"

## The Key Insight

Mobile Claude doesn't need to remember the code - it needs to remember WHERE the configuration is stored. Then it can:

1. Access the stored configuration
2. Use the endpoints and formats from that config
3. Execute trading brain functions
4. Collaborate with other Claude instances

This creates true persistent multi-device trading intelligence that survives all chat resets and device changes.
