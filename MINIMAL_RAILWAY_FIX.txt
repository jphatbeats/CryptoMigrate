Minimal Railway Configuration Commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Remove nixpacks.toml and use Railway auto-detection

- Removed problematic nixpacks.toml causing parsing errors
- Railway will auto-detect Python environment from requirements.txt
- Simplified deployment using Railway's default Python buildpack
- Includes OpenAI integration fix working locally
- Should resolve all Railway build configuration issues"

git push origin main

What This Approach Does:
1. Removes complex nixpacks configuration causing errors
2. Uses Railway's built-in Python auto-detection
3. Relies on requirements.txt for dependency management
4. Uses Procfile for simple startup command
5. Maintains OpenAI integration fix

Benefits:
- No more nixpacks parsing errors
- Railway's proven Python auto-detection
- Simpler configuration = fewer failure points
- OpenAI integration confirmed working locally

Expected Results:
- Railway build will succeed using auto-detection
- Python environment will be configured automatically
- Dependencies will install from requirements.txt
- OpenAI integration will work
- ChatGPT endpoints will return real AI analysis
