# Enhanced Smart Trading Bot - Multi-Channel Setup

Your existing `smart_trading_bot.py` has been enhanced to support your 3-channel Discord strategy!

## Current Setup Status

‚úÖ **Already Working**: Your `smart_trading_bot.py` is enhanced and ready
‚úÖ **Railway API Integration**: Connects to your live Railway API
‚úÖ **Multi-Channel Support**: Handles different webhooks for different channels
‚úÖ **Intelligent Content Routing**: Different alert types go to appropriate channels

## Quick Multi-Channel Setup

### Option 1: Multi-Channel Webhooks (Recommended)

Set these 3 environment variables for channel-specific content:

```bash
# Create a webhook for each channel and set these:
export DISCORD_ALERTS_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_ALERTS_WEBHOOK"
export DISCORD_PORTFOLIO_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_PORTFOLIO_WEBHOOK"  
export DISCORD_ALPHA_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_ALPHA_WEBHOOK"
```

### Option 2: Single Webhook (Current Setup)

Keep using your existing setup - all alerts go to one channel:

```bash
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_CURRENT_WEBHOOK"
```

## Your Channel Strategy

# - Scans for opportunities twice daily  
# - Monitors breaking news and risks
# - Routes content to appropriate channels
```

## No Breaking Changes

Your current setup keeps working exactly as before! The enhancements only activate when you add the multi-channel webhook environment variables.
