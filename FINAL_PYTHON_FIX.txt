Final Python-Only Railway Fix:

git add .
git commit -m "Force Railway to use Python buildpack instead of Node.js

- Removed package.json and node_modules causing Node.js detection
- Added .railwayignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Updated pyproject.toml with proper Python configuration
- Railway will now detect Python from requirements.txt and runtime.txt
- Includes working OpenAI integration fix
- Should resolve buildpack detection issues"

git push origin main

What This Fixes:
1. Removes Node.js files causing wrong buildpack detection
2. Forces Railway to use Python buildpack
3. Proper Python project structure
4. OpenAI integration working locally
5. Clean deployment without Node.js conflicts

Expected Results:
- Railway will detect this as Python project
- Python environment will be configured properly
- Dependencies will install from requirements.txt
- OpenAI integration will work
- ChatGPT endpoints will return real AI analysis
- No more "python: command not found" errors
