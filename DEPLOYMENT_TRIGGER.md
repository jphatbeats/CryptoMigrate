# Railway Deployment Trigger

## Enhanced Kraken MCP Deployment Status

**Current Issue**: Railway production hasn't deployed enhanced formatters yet
- Local enhanced code: ✅ Complete with trade history integration  
- Railway production: ❌ Still using old formatters (no USD values, no entry prices)

**Evidence**:
- Railway `/api/live/kraken-positions` returns: "$0.00 total value" and empty positions
- Railway `/api/kraken/balance` works: Shows actual portfolio data (AVAX: 285.6, JUP: 1057, etc.)
- Enhanced formatters include: real entry prices, trade dates, P&L calculations, USD values

**Solution**: Force Railway to detect code changes and redeploy

## Changes Made
- Enhanced trade history integration via `fetch_my_trades`
- Real entry price calculations using weighted averages
- Entry dates and timeline analysis  
- USD value integration via CoinGecko
- Complete risk analysis with TP/SL suggestions
- GPT-optimized data structure

## Expected Result After Deployment
Railway MCP endpoints will provide:
- Real entry prices from trade history
- Real entry dates and days held
- Real P&L calculations in USD and percentage
- Trade count per position  
- Comprehensive risk analysis
