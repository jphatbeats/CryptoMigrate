      "ai_insight": "Bitcoin's confidence score of 15.0% reflects a predominantly bearish outlook, driven by weak technical indicators such as a low RSI of 41.1 and a bearish MACD signal, alongside a recommendation to sell, resulting in a poor technical score of 10/50. Additionally, the absence of positive sentiment in recent news and social discussions further undermines market confidence, contributing to low news and social scores, suggesting traders should approach BTC with caution in the short term."
