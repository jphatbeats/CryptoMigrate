      "alert_triggered": false,
      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "The OP coin's low confidence score of 15.9% is primarily driven by the absence of positive news and social momentum, resulting in zero scores in both news and social analysis categories. Despite a strong technical score of 47.6/50, the bearish MACD signal and neutral recommendation suggest caution, indicating that traders should wait for clearer bullish signals or news catalysts before making significant moves."

      "alert_triggered": true,
      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "THETA's high confidence score of 90.6% is primarily driven by strong technical indicators, particularly a bullish MACD signal, and overwhelmingly positive recent news sentiment, which collectively contribute to a robust technical and news score. However, the lack of social momentum and neutral recommendation suggest traders should remain cautious and monitor for any shifts in market dynamics before making significant moves."

      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "ARB's score of 63.1% is primarily driven by its technical analysis, with a low RSI of 30.3 indicating oversold conditions and a bullish MACD signal suggesting potential upward momentum, leading to a buy recommendation. However, the lack of positive news catalysts and social momentum, reflected in a 0/30 news score and 0/20 social score, suggest limited external drivers for a price surge, which traders should consider when making decisions."

      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "The low confidence score of 31.0% for SAND is primarily driven by bearish technical indicators, including an RSI approaching overbought levels at 66.0 and a bearish MACD signal, which aligns with the sell recommendation. Additionally, the absence of news catalysts and negligible social momentum further contribute to the lack of positive sentiment, suggesting traders should exercise caution and consider the potential for a price decline."

      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "IMX's score of 45.4% is primarily driven by its technical indicators, notably an oversold RSI of 25.7, which indicates potential for a price reversal, despite the current bearish MACD signal. The lack of significant news catalysts and social momentum further dampens its outlook, suggesting traders should adopt a cautious, neutral stance until clearer market signals emerge."

      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "MANA's high confidence score of 95.0% is primarily driven by a robust news analysis, where 66.7% of recent articles exhibit positive sentiment and act as a catalyst for potential market movements, despite a neutral technical recommendation and lackluster social momentum. Traders should note the bullish MACD signal juxtaposed with an RSI of 42.6, indicating potential upward movement, but remain cautious given the absence of social buzz which could limit immediate price action."

      "ai_insight": "ALGO's confidence score of 95.0% is primarily driven by strong technical indicators, including a bullish MACD signal and an attractive RSI of 33.2, suggesting it is oversold and positioned for a potential upward correction. Despite the lack of social momentum, the positive sentiment in recent news and the presence of a catalyst further bolster the buy recommendation, making it an appealing option for traders looking for both technical and fundamental support."

      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "INJ's score of 40.4% is primarily driven by its technical analysis, where a relatively neutral RSI of 58.4 and a bearish MACD signal suggest indecisiveness among traders, leading to a neutral recommendation. The lack of impactful news catalysts and stagnant social momentum further contribute to the subdued score, indicating limited external influences or shifts in market sentiment at present."

      "ai_insight": "The 73.9% confidence score for VET is primarily driven by technical indicators signaling overbought conditions, with an RSI of 74.0 and a bearish MACD, alongside a recommendation to sell, resulting in a low technical score. Despite some positive news sentiment and catalysts, the lack of social momentum and sentiment suggests limited market enthusiasm, reinforcing the cautious outlook for traders."

      "ai_insight": "OP's score of 52.0% is primarily driven by a neutral technical outlook, with a slightly positive RSI of 54.3 and a bullish MACD signal indicating potential upward movement, counterbalanced by lackluster news and social momentum, which provide no significant catalysts or sentiment boosts. Traders should be cautious, as the absence of strong external drivers suggests limited immediate upside potential and the need for further developments to strengthen the coin's position."
