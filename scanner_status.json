      "ai_insight": "INJ's confidence score of 50.2% reflects a technically neutral stance, primarily due to the bearish MACD signal and an oversold RSI of 28.1, suggesting potential for a price rebound. However, the lack of significant news catalysts and social momentum indicates limited immediate external influence, urging traders to watch for technical developments or emerging news that could sway market sentiment."

      "ai_insight": "Ethereum currently has a low confidence score of 15.0%, primarily driven by bearish technical indicators such as an RSI below 50 and a bearish MACD signal, coupled with neutral recommendations and a weak technical score of 19.7 out of 50. While news sentiment shows a slightly positive tilt with a news catalyst present, the lack of social momentum and sentiment (both at 0%) further contributes to the low score, suggesting traders should remain cautious as the market lacks strong positive catalysts."
