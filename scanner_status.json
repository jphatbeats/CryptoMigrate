      "ai_insight": "GRT's confidence score of 15.0% is primarily impacted by a lack of news and social momentum, reflected in its zero scores in both categories, despite a bullish MACD signal. Traders should note the overbought RSI of 72.2, indicating potential for a price pullback, and the neutral recommendation suggests caution due to weak overall technical support."
