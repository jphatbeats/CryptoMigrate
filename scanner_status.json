      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "SHIB's low confidence score of 15.0% is primarily driven by the absence of positive catalysts across technical, news, and social dimensions, with indicators like a bearish MACD and a neutral recommendation reflecting tepid technical momentum. Traders should note the lack of news and social engagement, indicating minimal immediate interest or potential for price movement, suggesting a cautious approach in the short term."

      "ai_insight": "FTM's score of 55.4% is primarily driven by a moderately bullish technical setup, indicated by an RSI of 69.1 and a bullish MACD signal, yet tempered by a neutral overall recommendation. The absence of positive news or social momentum suggests limited external catalysts to drive significant price changes, urging traders to remain cautious and closely monitor technical indicators for potential shifts."

      "ai_insight": "AVAX's low confidence score of 15.0% is driven primarily by bearish technical indicators, including a high RSI of 66.2 and a bearish MACD signal, alongside a weak social momentum and sentiment that fail to provide support for a positive outlook. Despite some positive sentiment in recent news, the lack of viral potential and inadequate social engagement suggest limited immediate upside, reinforcing the sell recommendation."

Traders should note the lack of positive sentiment and catalytic news, as these factors significantly dampen the overall outlook, suggesting caution despite the technical resilience."

      "status": "completed",
      "ai_insight": "AXS currently has a confidence score of 59.0% largely due to its technical analysis, which reveals a bearish MACD signal and an RSI of 35.2, indicating potential oversold conditions amidst a neutral recommendation. The lack of positive news and negligible social momentum further contribute to the subdued sentiment, suggesting traders should remain cautious and look for more definitive signals before taking action."

Despite some positive news sentiment, its limited impact is insufficient to counteract the prevailing technical and social analysis weaknesses, advising traders to approach with caution."

Traders should be cautious as the sell recommendation reflects current bearish sentiment without any counteracting positive news or social engagement to suggest a reversal."

However, the absence of significant news catalysts and stagnant social momentum indicate a lack of broader market interest, which traders should consider when evaluating potential entry points."
