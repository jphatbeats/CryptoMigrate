# API Limitations & Workarounds

## Current API Status Issues

### CoinMarketCap Pro API
**Issue**: Error 1006 - "API Key subscription plan doesn't support this endpoint"
**Affected Endpoint**: `getCoinMarketCapTrending`
**Status**: API key exists but on basic plan

**Workaround Solutions:**
1. Use `getCoinMarketCapListings` with `sort=percent_change_24h` for trending analysis
2. Use `getCoinMarketCapGlobalMetrics` for market overview
3. Cross-reference with DexScreener for viral token discovery
4. Rely on Railway endpoints for LunarCrush trending data

### LunarCrush API  
**Issue**: "ResponseTooLargeError" on `getTrendingTopics`
**Cause**: Missing LunarCrush API key in secrets OR payload too large
**Status**: No direct LunarCrush API key found

**Workaround Solutions:**
1. Use Railway platform LunarCrush endpoints (if available)
2. Focus on individual coin Galaxy Score lookups instead of bulk trending
3. Use DexScreener + CryptoNews for social sentiment alternatives
4. Request LunarCrush API key if needed for direct access

## Recommended Action Plan

**Immediate Solutions:**
- Continue using working endpoints: Railway, BingX, DexScreener, CryptoNews
- Use CoinMarketCap listings with sorting instead of trending endpoint
- Focus on individual LunarCrush coin lookups rather than trending topics

**For Enhanced Access:**
- Consider upgrading CoinMarketCap Pro plan for trending endpoints
- Add LunarCrush API key to secrets for direct access
- Use Railway platform as primary source for social intelligence
