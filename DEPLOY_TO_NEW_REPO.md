# Deploy Working Code to New Repository

## New Repository
https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Local Alpha Playbook working perfectly (GALA: 85.0%, JASMY: 93.3%)
- ‚úÖ RSI market scanning processes 60 symbols locally
- ‚ùå Git authentication blocking automatic deployment
- üéØ Need to get working code to new repository for Railway deployment

## Manual Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Direct File Upload to GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway
2. Upload these key files from this Replit:
   - `main_server.py` (the working version with RSI fixes)
   - `taapi_universal_indicators.py`  
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `Procfile`
   - Any other Python files needed for Railway

### Option 2: Clone and Copy (Outside Replit)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway.git
# Copy working files from this Replit
cd finalrailway
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy working RSI market scanning system"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Connect Railway to New Repository
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Create new project from GitHub
3. Connect to: https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway
4. Deploy automatically

## Key Files to Include
- ‚úÖ `main_server.py` (with taapi_universal fixes)
- ‚úÖ `taapi_universal_indicators.py`
- ‚úÖ `exchange_manager.py`
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt`
- ‚úÖ `Procfile`
- ‚úÖ Environment variable configuration

## Expected Result
Once deployed to Railway via new repository:
- RSI scans will process 60 symbols instead of 0
- ChatGPT Custom Actions will work perfectly
- All market scanning endpoints operational

Your Alpha Playbook is crushing it locally - let's get Railway to match that performance!
