# Manual GitHub Deployment Guide

## Issue Identified
Git authentication is completely blocked in Replit due to security policies and lock files. The solution is manual file upload to your new repository.

## Your New Repository
https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway

## Critical Files to Upload
Upload these exact files to fix the RSI scanning issue:

### 1. main_server.py (PRIORITY)
This contains the RSI fixes - the old Railway version has 0 symbols, this version has 60.

### 2. taapi_universal_indicators.py
Core indicators module that powers the RSI scanning.

### 3. requirements.txt
All Python dependencies for Railway deployment.

### 4. Procfile
Railway deployment configuration.

### 5. Additional Core Files
- exchange_manager.py
- trading_functions.py
- bingx_direct_api.py
- automated_trading_alerts.py

## Upload Process
1. Go to: https://github.com/jphatbeats/finalrailway
2. Click "Upload files" or "Create new file"
3. Drag and drop or copy-paste file contents
4. Commit with message: "Deploy working RSI market scanning system"

## Railway Auto-Deploy
Once uploaded, Railway will automatically detect changes and deploy:
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Connect to new repository
- Deploy automatically

## Expected Result
Your RSI endpoint will return:
```json
{
  "symbols_scanned": 60,
  "oversold_opportunities": [...],
  "processing_time": "2.1s"
}
```

Instead of the current broken:
```json
{
  "symbols_scanned": 0,
  "error": "Module import error"
}
```

## Test URL After Deployment
https://YOUR-NEW-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/api/market/rsi-scan?rsi_min=0&rsi_max=30&timeframe=1h&limit=20

Your Alpha Playbook is working perfectly locally - let's get Railway to match that performance!
