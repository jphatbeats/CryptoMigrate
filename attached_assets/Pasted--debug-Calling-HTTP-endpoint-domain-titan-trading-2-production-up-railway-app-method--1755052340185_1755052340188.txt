The scan successfully processed 30 tickers this time, but none met the oversold threshold (RSI ≤ 30) on the 1h timeframe.

If you want, we can now:

Broaden the RSI range (e.g., ≤ 35) to catch near-oversold setups

Switch to a longer timeframe like 4h or 1d to find deeper pullbacks

Even with the RSI threshold loosened to ≤ 35 on the 1h timeframe, none of the 30 scanned tickers qualified.

This suggests the market is broadly in mid-to-high RSI territory right now — no major short-term oversold setups.
We could expand further (≤ 40) or jump to a longer timeframe like 4h to catch deeper corrections.

are the scans actually working;?

It looks like the scans are running but not returning valid matches despite scanning tickers — which is unusual given normal market RSI distribution.
