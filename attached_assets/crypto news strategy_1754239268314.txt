**NOW GO DOMINATE THE MARKET!** 🚀💎🔥

L2

RWA

Memecoins

Infrastructure

Watch for:

Spike in mentions across multiple coins in the same narrative

Articles hinting at upcoming token utility, staking, governance, or rollouts

🧠 When a sector rotation starts, move capital early, especially from lagging bags.

🧯 3. Scam / Rug / Exploit Detection
Use getCryptoRiskAlerts and filter by:

“Matched flags”: honeypot, blacklist, admin key, exploit, unusual permission, sudden mint

Red flags:

News mentions of smart contract vulnerabilities (Curve, Friend.tech)

Suspicious new token launch with big hype but no audit

Project controls upgrade or pause functions secretly

News spike + no price movement = likely botted/fake pump

⚠️ If risk + no real volume → do not enter

⛏️ 4. Hidden Gem Mining
Use:

scanCryptoOpportunities (opportunity type = pump, partnership)

getBreakingCryptoNews with exclude_portfolio=true

Look for:

Projects with small caps, but high confidence in news signals

News from mid-tier sources before majors pick it up

Sentiment = positive, but no Reddit/Twitter traction yet

These are pre-viral — sniper level entries if TA confirms (RSI, BB squeeze, etc.)

❌ 5. Exit Triggers & Risk Monitoring
Use:

getCryptoRiskAlerts

getCryptoNewsBySymbols(symbols=...)

Exit when:

Coin you're holding gets flagged in risk news

Sentiment flips negative across multiple sources

News includes keywords: hack, rug, delist, frozen, FBI, probe, legal, stolen

→ Tag trades as cut, or rotate immediately unless it's a long-term conviction vault.

🧩 6. News-Based Trade Grading
Grade setups using:

Grade	Conditions
🟢 Sniper	Fresh positive news + no price move yet + RSI < 50
🟡 Momentum	Positive news + already moving + confirmed volume
🔴 Avoid	High hype + negative news or rug flags

🧭 News-Driven Playbook Examples
🚨 News: “Fetch.ai partners with Intel”
Action: Backtest FET RSI & MACD

Tag: Sniper if price flat

Upgrade: If Twitter volume confirms, it’s a Runner

💥 News: “Friend.tech contract flagged as centralized”
Action: Check wallet inflows

If holding: Immediate risk review
