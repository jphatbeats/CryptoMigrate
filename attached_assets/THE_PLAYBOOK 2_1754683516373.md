# 🎯 THE ALPHA PLAYBOOK

## 🧠 System Purpose

This playbook powers the mission to grow $20K into $1M via asymmetric, real-time alpha — with *realized profits*, not just paper gains.

Every file in this system is a **modular weapon** for signal confluence, sniper entries, and rug avoidance. This repo blends **on-chain and off-chain** intelligence from:
- 🗞️ CryptoNews API
- 🌕 LunarCrush Premium
- 📊 Technical triggers (RSI, MACD, BB, etc.)
- 🧠 Sentiment, narrative, and volatility tracking

---

## 📂 FILE STRUCTURE

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CRYPTONEWS_STRATEGY.md` | Real-world catalyst scanner (headlines, risks, bullish signals) |
| `LUNARCRUSH_STRATEGY.md` | Social sentiment engine, narrative confirmation, trend detection |
| `CRYPTO_INTEL_ENGINE.md` | Unified execution protocol — sniper logic when both tools align |

---

## 🧠 USAGE FLOW

### 1. Morning Activation

- Run `getBreakingCryptoNews`, `getBullishSignals`
- Run LunarCrush `getTrendingCoinsToday`, `getAltRankGainers`
- Tag anything that aligns in **both sources**

### 2. Build Watchlist

- Filter using RSI, MACD, BB for each tagged coin
- Add labels: `Sniper`, `Runner`, `Monitor`, `Avoid`, `Rotate`

### 3. Execute Trade Logic

Use `CRYPTO_INTEL_ENGINE.md`:

- Only enter if **3-legged confluence** (News + Social + Technical)
- Scale in based on momentum or Galaxy Score trend
- Rotate out as social sentiment fades or risk alerts fire

### 4. Monitor Risk & Fakes

- Scan `/risk-alerts` (CryptoNews) and `Spam Score` (Lunar)
- Exit if: exploit, delist, rug confirmed or social collapses
- Flag “no news + social spike” as likely bot activity

---

## 🧠 CONFLUENCE FILTERING

**Greenlight Setup:**
- ✅ `CryptoNews`: Bullish news w/ high urgency
- ✅ `LunarCrush`: GS > 65, AltRank dropping
- ✅ `TA`: RSI rising, MACD flip, BB breakout

**Caution Setup:**
- ❗ No news, social spike, RSI flat
- ❗ Galaxy Score < 50, Spam rising

**Exit Now:**
- ❌ Rug / delist / exploit news
- ❌ GS collapses + Whale outflows

---

## ⚠️ MISTAKES TO AVOID

- ❌ Chasing Galaxy Score > 80 without RSI confirmation
- ❌ Trading off hype headlines w/ no volume or social lift
- ❌ Ignoring risk alerts from De.Fi, Arkham, or Unverified Contracts
- ❌ Holding through confirmed rug/delist FUD

## 🧠 FINAL NOTE

> Don’t think in coins. Think in **confluence**.

The Alpha Playbook isn’t about being early to hype — it’s about being **right at the inflection point**, where news, social, and price agree. The sniper doesn’t fire often — but when they do, they don’t miss.
