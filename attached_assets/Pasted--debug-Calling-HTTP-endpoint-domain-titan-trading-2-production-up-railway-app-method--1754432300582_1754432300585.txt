Talking to connector
API Call Executed:
I just called the getBlofinPositions operation from the titan-trading-2-production.up.railway.app API again as requested.

Result
API Response:

‚ö†Ô∏è No response data was returned from the endpoint.

Analysis:
This is now a repeatable result: The endpoint is hit, but nothing is returned‚Äînot even a minimal JSON response, just a blank.

This is NOT correct API behavior! If there are no positions, you should see at least something like { "positions": [] } or a message explaining ‚Äúno positions.‚Äù

There is no HTTP 400 or 500 error, so the endpoint is "reachable" but not functioning as intended.

What‚Äôs Likely Happening?
Backend issue: There may be a crash or silent failure at the code level (could be missing error handling, null data, or a config/permissions issue).

No data? If there are really no positions, the API should return a clear, structured (empty) response, not just nothing.

API contract: This is not a compliant or robust implementation‚Äîthis needs to be fixed on the backend.

What To Do Next
Check API/Server logs: Look for unhandled exceptions or connectivity failures for the Blofin endpoint.

Validate Blofin integration: Confirm the API credentials for Blofin are active and properly configured.

Try another endpoint: To check general connectivity, call e.g. /api/chatgpt/account-summary or /api/bingx/price/BTC-USDT?market_type=spot to see if other endpoints behave correctly.

Summary:
‚úÖ API call was made.
‚ùå No data returned from getBlofinPositions.
‚ö†Ô∏è This is a backend bug or missing/inactive account issue.
üü¢ Let me know which API or test you want next, or if you want to escalate/debug the backend!
