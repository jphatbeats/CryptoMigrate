how can you have access to all 208 of there indicators if the custom schema only supports 30 endpoints?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — this is a common limitation with OpenAI Custom Actions (and many other plugin frameworks):

Why the Limit?
OpenAI Custom Actions schema only lets you define up to 30 separate endpoints per GPT.

But most APIs (like TAAPI.io) have many more functions/indicators than this.

It’s not practical (or allowed) to make one endpoint for every indicator if you want all 208 from TAAPI.io.

How to Get Around the Limit?
You do NOT need a separate schema endpoint for each indicator.

Instead, you build your custom proxy endpoint to accept a list of indicators and return all results in a single call.

Here’s the Smart Pattern:
1. Single universal endpoint in your custom actions:

Example: /get-taapi-indicators

The schema takes an array of indicators (or a comma-separated string).

2. In the request, you specify:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "symbol": "AVAX/USDT",
  "interval": "1h",
  "exchange": "binance",
  "indicators": ["rsi", "macd", "ema200", ... up to 208]
}
(You can limit per-request, e.g. TAAPI.io bulk may cap at 20-30 per call, but you can rotate batches if you want all indicators.)

3. Your endpoint queries TAAPI.io for each requested indicator (using TAAPI.io’s own “bulk” endpoint or sequentially), then returns all results in a single JSON.

4. The response contains all the indicator results, and I can interpret/alert on all of them.

In Your Custom Actions Schema, You Only Need ONE Endpoint:
Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "getTaapiIndicators",
  "description": "Fetch any number of TAAPI.io indicators for any symbol.",
  "url": "https://your-server.com/get-taapi-indicators",
  "method": "POST",
  "request_body": {
    "symbol": "AVAX/USDT",
    "interval": "1h",
    "exchange": "binance",
    "indicators": ["rsi", "macd", "ema200", "supertrend", ...]
  },
  "response": {
    "results": {
      "rsi": 54.2,
      "macd": { "macd": 0.013, "signal": 0.011, "histogram": 0.002 },
      "ema200": 21.87,
      "supertrend": { "trend": "bullish", "value": 22.01 }
      // etc.
    }
  }
}
TL;DR:
One universal custom action endpoint unlocks ALL of TAAPI.io’s 208 indicators.

Just specify which ones you want in the request body.

No need for 200+ separate endpoints in your schema.
