Talking to connector
API Call Executed:
I called the getKrakenBalance operation from the titan-trading-2-production.up.railway.app API as requested.

Result
API Response:

⚠️ No response data was returned from the endpoint.

Error Analysis
Pattern matches other issues:
The endpoint was reached, but returned no data at all. This is the same as with the Blofin and BingX position endpoints.

No 400/401/403/500 error:
The network is working, but the backend is not returning a valid JSON response.

Not an account/balance error:
Even if the Kraken account was empty or not linked, the expected response should be a structure with zeros or an error message—not nothing.

Likely Causes
Backend code bug or silent failure

Credentials issue but not handled gracefully in the code

API response misconfiguration or missing data model

No error handler/fallback in the API route

Recommended Troubleshooting
Backend logs: Check logs for stack traces, unhandled exceptions, or API credential errors for the Kraken balance function.

Review API response contract: Ensure even error or empty data always returns valid JSON ({ "balance": 0 } or { "error": "No connection to Kraken" }).

Test another endpoint: See if any endpoints return valid data (for example, try an endpoint not reliant on exchange credentials).

Credentials health: Double-check that your Kraken API key is live and not expired/changed.

Summary:

✅ API call succeeded (network/protocol OK)

❌ No data returned from getKrakenBalance

⚠️ This is a backend/API issue—not a user/client problem.

Needs code fix or at least graceful error handling on the API!
