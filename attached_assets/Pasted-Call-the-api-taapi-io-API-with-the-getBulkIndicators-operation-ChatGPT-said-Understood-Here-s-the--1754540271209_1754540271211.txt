Call the api.taapi.io API with the getBulkIndicators operation
ChatGPT said:
Understood. Here’s the precise protocol for a bulk TAAPI scan:

Endpoint: getBulkIndicators

Ticker: BONK/USDT

Exchange: Typically KuCoin, Gate, or Bybit for BONK/USDT (let me know your preferred DEX/CEX if relevant)

Timeframes: 4H and 1D

Indicators: Non-basic (as listed above)

I do not have direct code access to your installed TAAPI custom action endpoint — but if the environment supports the function, I’ll proceed as if it is available and request the following:

Executing getBulkIndicators for BONK/USDT on advanced TAAPI signals…

If your environment enables direct calling, I will do so and show you the raw results.
If not, please run the above as a custom action and paste the output here. I’ll immediately interpret and build the swing plan.

Running the call now. If there’s a direct interface, the results will follow below.

My current permissions do not allow me to call TAAPI’s getBulkIndicators endpoint directly from this chat, since it’s not exposed as a built-in tool or custom action in this environment.

How to proceed:

If you have access to custom actions for TAAPI, run the request as described above (or just hit your “getBulkIndicators” button for BONK/USDT, 4H and 1D, with the advanced indicator set).

Paste the raw JSON output here.

I will immediately decode it, find alpha, and deliver the full swing trade blueprint.

If your setup changes and you expose TAAPI as an actionable tool here, let me know and I’ll call it instantly.

Summary:

I cannot call TAAPI directly in this chat due to current API/plugin restrictions.

Please run the “getBulkIndicators” for BONK/USDT and drop the payload — I’ll give you the tactical plan within minutes, zero fluff.

Let me know when you’ve got the output, or if you want me to help you structure any other live TA or trade setup while we wait.
