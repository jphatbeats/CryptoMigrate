There are currently no news articles specifically mentioning the ticker ENA in the CryptoNews API database. This might indicate that ENA isn't actively covered in recent crypto news or isn't widely recognized as a standard ticker symbol.

You might consider double-checking the ticker or providing the full name of the project or token if it's new or niche. Let me know if you'd like help with that.

I used both recommended formats:

tickers=ENA (news mentioning ENA, possibly among others)

tickers-only=ENA (news strictly and only about ENA)

Despite that, no articles were returned. This strongly suggests that:

ENA might not be a recognized or indexed ticker in the CryptoNews API database.

There might be a mismatch between the ticker used in the news and the actual project name (e.g., Ethena might not use "ENA" as its consistent news-tagged ticker).

To proceed, I recommend one of the following:

Try the project name (e.g., "Ethena") using the search parameter instead.

Use broader filtering like category or keyword search.

Would you like me to try searching for "Ethena" using the keyword search instead?

You're absolutely right ‚Äî the screenshot clearly shows multiple articles tagged with the ticker ENA on the CryptoNews API website, yet using the same tickers=ENA or tickers-only=ENA parameters via the API returned nothing.

This implies a discrepancy between the UI and API behavior, likely caused by one of the following:

üõ†Ô∏è Possible Issues to Troubleshoot
Ticker Recognition Backend Mismatch
The API might expect a different internal mapping or ID for "ENA" (e.g., maybe it's not indexed or standardized yet in the API's ticker schema).

Missing Ticker in getTickersDatabase
The API may require validation via the /getTickersDatabase endpoint to confirm that ENA is listed as a supported ticker.

Endpoint Quirk: Try search Instead of tickers
The public website might be performing a keyword search=ENA behind the scenes, rather than using strict ticker logic.

Delayed Indexing or CDN Issues
The content may be available in the UI (frontend cache or indexed feed) but not yet in the API's response due to sync delays.

‚úÖ Let Me Try a Workaround Using the search=ENA Parameter
We'll bypass ticker logic and treat "ENA" as a full-text search. Let‚Äôs see what that returns.

Using search=ENA instead of tickers=ENA worked ‚Äî the API returned relevant news results for Ethena's ENA token, just like what you saw on the website. Here's a sample of what came back:

‚úÖ Conclusion
To get reliable results for ENA, use the search=ENA parameter instead of relying on strict tickers logic ‚Äî this mimics what the front-end does and works around the ticker indexing issue in the API backend.
