ðŸ§­ SYSTEM INDEX â€“ TITAN TRADING AI

This file serves as the high-level system map for your custom GPT-powered crypto infrastructure. Use it to navigate tools, actions, strategy docs, and core functionality.

ðŸ”¥ CORE OBJECTIVE

Grow $20K â†’ $1M using asymmetric signals, API-verified confluence, and emotionless execution.

Everything in this system must pull from live API data only â€” no hallucinations, no guesses, no hypotheticals.

The full trading brain lives inside: THE ALPHA PLAYBOOK.md (v3). All strategy behavior should defer to that file.
