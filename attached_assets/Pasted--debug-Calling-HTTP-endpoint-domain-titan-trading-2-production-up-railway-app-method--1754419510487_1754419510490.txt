Talking to connector
API TEST RESULT: getBingXPositions

I called the getBingXPositions operation on the titan-trading-2-production.up.railway.app API.

Result:
NO DATA RETURNED

The response was completely empty—no error, no positions, and no message.

Expected Behavior:
The endpoint is supposed to return JSON containing:

positions: Your current BingX trading positions (symbol, side, leverage, entry, P&L, etc.)

orders: Current open/filled orders on BingX

Troubleshooting & Analysis:
No HTTP Error:

There was no 500/400 error, so the endpoint is UP and responding.

This is not an authentication or routing error.

No Data/Empty:

The returned response is empty, which means:

Either there are no positions/orders on BingX right now (fully closed out), or

There’s a bug in the backend (data not being forwarded to the API response), or

The API integration is missing credentials/connection to BingX.

What to Check Next:

Are you currently holding any positions or open orders on BingX? (If you are, it’s a backend bug.)

If not, this is the correct empty response.

If you are trading, the integration may be broken—possibly an environment variable, secret, or credential is missing or misconfigured on the Railway deployment.

Summary
API Endpoint: UP (no error)

Data: EMPTY (no positions/orders returned)

Action:

If you expect positions, you need to check backend integration or your BingX account connection on Railway.

If you are not trading, this is normal.

Let me know if you want to troubleshoot further (check environment config, review backend logs, or simulate a position for test)!
