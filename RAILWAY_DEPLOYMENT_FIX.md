# URGENT: Railway Deployment Fix for RSI Market Scanning

## Current Problem
- **Local Server:** RSI scan working perfectly (60 symbols scanned)
- **Railway Server:** Still running old buggy code (0 symbols scanned)  
- **ChatGPT:** Connecting to Railway = gets 0 results

## The Fix (Two Options)

### Option 1: Quick GitHub Authentication Fix
```bash
# Update your git remote with personal access token
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/jphatbeats/CryptoMigrate.git
git push origin main --force
```

### Option 2: Manual Railway Push
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Manually trigger a deployment
3. Or reconnect your GitHub repository

## What's Fixed in Local Code
- Changed `taapi_universal_indicators` to `taapi_universal` 
- RSI scan now processes 60 symbols instead of 0
- All market scanning endpoints working perfectly

## Expected Result After Fix
ChatGPT RSI scans will show:
```json
{
  "symbols_scanned": 60,  // Instead of 0
  "results_found": [actual_results]
}
```

## Verification
Test with: https://titan-trading-2-production.up.railway.app/api/market/rsi-scan?rsi_min=0&rsi_max=30&timeframe=1h&limit=20

Should return `symbols_scanned: 60` not `symbols_scanned: 0`
