# ChatGPT Schema Deployment Guide

## Current Setup

You now have **two separate schemas** for ChatGPT:

### 1. Public BingX Schema (`public_bingx_schema.json`)
- **Server:** `https://open-api.bingx.com` (BingX direct)
- **Purpose:** Market data, prices, candlesticks, order books
- **Authentication:** None required
- **Endpoints:**
  - `getBingXTicker` - Real-time prices
  - `getBingXCandlesticks` - OHLCV data  
  - `getBingXOrderBook` - Market depth
  - `getBingXContracts` - Available symbols

### 2. Private Railway Schema (`private_trading_schema.json`)
- **Server:** `https://titan-trading-2-production.up.railway.app` (Your Railway)
- **Purpose:** Trading positions, portfolio analysis
- **Authentication:** Your API keys (handled by Railway)
- **Endpoints:**
  - `getAllExchangePositions` - Your live positions
  - `getPortfolioAnalysis` - AI portfolio analysis

## How to Use

**For market research:** Use `public_bingx_schema.json`
- "What's the current price of BTC?"
- "Show me ETH candlestick data"
- "What's the order book for SOL-USDT?"

**For portfolio management:** Use `private_trading_schema.json`  
- "Analyze my trading positions"
- "What's my current portfolio performance?"
- "Give me AI recommendations for my trades"

## Next Steps

1. Upload `public_bingx_schema.json` to ChatGPT for market data queries
2. Upload `private_trading_schema.json` to ChatGPT for portfolio analysis
3. Test both schemas work independently
4. Your Railway deployment is ready and working
