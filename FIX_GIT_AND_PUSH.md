# Auto-Fix Git and Push Discord Integration

## Quick Setup (One-Time):

Run this command with your GitHub token to fix git permanently:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/jphatbeats/titan-trading-2.git
```

## Then Push Your Discord Integration:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## After This Setup:
- All future git pushes will work automatically
- No more authentication issues
- Your Discord bot integration will sync to GitHub
- Railway will auto-deploy immediately

## What Happens Next:
1. GitHub shows latest commit from jphatbeats (no more "2 hours ago")
2. Railway detects changes and redeploys automatically
3. Add DISCORD_TOKEN to Railway environment variables
4. TITAN BOT#6444 runs on Railway with AI-enhanced alerts

Your Discord integration is ready - just need this one git push!
